		Hollow Sense is an indie game studio focused on crafting narrative-driven horror experiences. We operate at the intersection of classic survival horror design and the cutting-edge technical capabilities of Unreal Engine 5, prioritizing robust engineering to bring atmospheric worlds to life.

	<p>Our mission is to explore fear through meticulous environmental storytelling and refined gameplay mechanics. This DevLog serves as a transparent record of our development journey, documenting our technical architecture, design philosophy, and the creative process behind our titles.</p>
